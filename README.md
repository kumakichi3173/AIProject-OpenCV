# AIProject-OpenCV
In this AI Project, OpenCV and Jupiter were used. Jupiter is a great tool to implement codes because it can run the code piece by piece. It easily allows users to find errors.
Anaconda was used as an environment instead of Visual Studio because it is easy to understand for beginners because it is simple to run. 

Here is the link for the project:

Step 1: read the image and display it on Jupyter using Python. Rotate the picture.   

Step 2: Gamma correction
- make one that is dark and another one a bright one using the MRI image. 
- do the same using aerial image.

Step 3: Apply a smoothing filter to these images.

Step 4: Apply Sobel edge detector to an image and find edges in the image. 

These processes are in the folder above link.
